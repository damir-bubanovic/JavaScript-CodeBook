TodoMVC - MV* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps
	+) The ToDo Requirements - 	To ensure the apps are easily comparable, the ToDo wranglers 
								have provided a set of programming guidelines
	+) AngularJS - 	AngularJS is the Big Daddy in frameworks. It’s one of the most popular, 
					and most widely used. It is a complete MVC framework, and is sponsored by 
					Google, which adds to overall stability of the project
	+) Backbone.js - 	The Backbone.js architecture example ToDo application reflects the simpler 
						infrastructure that is Backbone.js
	+) Ember.js - Ember.js is dependent on jQuery and Handlebars.js for templating
	
	COMPARISON:
		> AngularJS is the most mature of the frameworks, and arguably, the most popular.
		It features in the MEAN stack, as in MongoDB-Express-AngularJS-Node.
		> Ember.js has an infrastructure that could more easily match what
		we’re used to, coming in from an Express background
		> Backbone.js’s goal to minimize its source is a commendable goal
