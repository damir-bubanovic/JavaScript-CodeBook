!!INTER - TESTING & ACCESS - TESTING YOUR APPLICATION IN VARIOUS ENVIROMENTS!!

> You have a set of environments (operating system and browser) you need to support,
but you don’t have enough machines to test your application or library in each
environment

*/

/*
SOLUTION:
> Use an emulating tool or browser testing service that can test your application in all of
your environments. These aids help you not only test the integrity of the code, but the
appearance and behavior of your user interface

> Emulators are a favorite for mobile developers. Some are specific to a browser, such as
Ripple for Chrome. Others are standalone tools like Opera Mobile Classic Emulator,
shown in Figure 6-2 or the Android Emulator (part of the Android SDK).
	>> Download the Opera emulator, or access Ripple for Chrome at the Google Web Store. 
	>> An excellent resource for discovering emulators is the Emulator page at “Breaking the Mobile Web”
	
> A variation for testing mobile applications is a simulator, which simulates some of the
environment but doesn’t fully emulate it at the hardware level. An example of a simulator
is Apple’s iOS Simulator


> cross-browser testing service (BrowserStack or Sauce Labs), or an application like Ghostlab

> You might also consider automated testing services, where you create a script that’s automatically 
run (Selenium is an example). 
	>> The key is to look for a service or tool that provides interactive testing
	
> One of the services I have used is BrowserStack
