!!INTER - LIBRARIES - HOSTING YOUR LIBRARY!!

> You want to open source your code, but you donâ€™t want to have to maintain the libraries
on your own server

*/

/*
SOLUTION:
> Use one of the source code sites to host your code, and provide the tools to manage
collaboration with other developers

> strongly encourage open sourcing your libraries as much as possible

> One source code host is Google Code, which contains a simple user interface to start a
new project and upload code
> Another very popular host for open source projects is GitHub
