!!INTER - TESTING & ACCESS - PERFORMANCE TESTING DIFFERENT CODING TECHNIQUES!!

> In JavaScript there are, typically, multiple ways you can code a solution. The problem
then becomes determining which of the different ways performs best across different
environments

/*
SOLUTION:
1) One approach is to use a performance testing tool, such as jsPerf, to try out the different
approaches and then proceed accordingly
	>> Look up instaling and using jsPerf
	
> JsPerf is built on Benchmark.js, which is also available for separate use. 
The test case in the solution can be accessed at http://jsperf.com/anony. 
There are numerous performance and load testing tools to use with Node.js applications. 
One I’ve used is Selenium.

2) Another approach to performance testing is profiling. Most browser debuggers have a
built-in profiling capability. 
	>> npr. the popular Firebug debugger for Firefox has profiling built in and available with 
	the click of the “Profile” button
	>> >> Look up using this feature (on all browsers)
	
	> HINT <
		You do want to make sure all of your browser extensions are disabled
		when you run a profiling tool in your browser, as these will
		impact the results. In fact, you want to eliminate or minimize any
		extension when you’re testing your code
