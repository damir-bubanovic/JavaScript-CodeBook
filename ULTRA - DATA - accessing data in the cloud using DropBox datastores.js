!!ULTRA - DATA - ACCESSING DATA IN THE CLOUD USING DROPBOX DATASTORES!!

> You have data in your application that you want to sync between all variations of your
app: whether in a web page, an Android app, or a Node service

*/

/*
SOLUTION

> Use a cloud-based datastore system, such as Google Drive, Amazon S3, or a Dropbox
Datastore. For this recipe, I’m focusing on Dropbox.

> To utilize Dropbox data storage in your application, you have to create a new app first.
When you create the new app, Dropbox will ask if you’re creating a Drop-in app or a
Dropbox API app. Pick the latter.

> Next, you’ll be asked if you want to store “Files and datastores”, or “datastores, only”.
Pick the “datastores only” option.

> Last, the page asks for an app name. Once you provide it, you’re all set. The tabbed page
that opens provides the App key and App secret in the first tab page
