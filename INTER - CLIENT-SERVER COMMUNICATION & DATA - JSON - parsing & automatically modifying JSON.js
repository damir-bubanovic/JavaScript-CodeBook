counterparts (true and false)

SOLUTION:

5. To transform the numeric values to their Boolean counterparts, create a reviver

EXAMPLE:
> To figure out how to create JSON, think about how you create an object literal and just
translate it into a string (with some caveats)
1) If the object is an array, 2) the JSON notation would be equivalent to the literal notation for the array
